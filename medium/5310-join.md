<h2> Problem </h2>

Implement the type version of Array.join, `Join<T, U>` takes an Array T, string or number U and returns the Array T with U stitching up.

```ts
type Res = Join<["a", "p", "p", "l", "e"], "-">; // expected to be 'a-p-p-l-e'
type Res1 = Join<["Hello", "World"], " ">; // expected to be 'Hello World'
type Res2 = Join<["2", "2", "2"], 1>; // expected to be '21212'
type Res3 = Join<["o"], "u">; // expected to be 'o'
```

<h2> My Solution </h2>

```ts
type Join<T extends any[], U extends string | number> = T extends [
  infer F,
  ...infer R
]
  ? R["length"] extends 0
    ? `${F & string}`
    : `${F & string}${U}${Join<R, U>}`
  : never;
```

<h2> Notes </h2>

Using `infer`, we extract the first element as `F` and the remaining elements as `R`.
We check if `R` is empty by verifying if its `length` extends 0. If `R` is empty, we simply return `F` without joining it with `U`. If `R` is not empty, we join `U` after `F` and recursively call `Join<R, U>` to continue joining the rest of the elements `R` and `U`.

The `&` operator is used to perform a type intersection. By intersecting `F` with the string type using `F & string`, we ensure that the inferred type `F` is compatible with the `string` type.

In TypeScript, when we perform a type intersection `(A & B)`, the resulting type is the intersection of all properties and methods from types `A` and `B`. In this case, `F & string` represents the intersection of the inferred type `F` with the `string` type, which means the resulting type must have all properties and methods present in both `F` and `string`. Since `string` is a built-in type in TypeScript, the intersection will ensure that `F` is assignable to `string`.

When we use Union Types and Intersection Types, think of two different types as two distinct sets. Once we understand their subsets and supersets, it might become easier to expect the resulting types.
